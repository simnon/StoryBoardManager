Story Board Manager Generator
=========
---------

StoryBoardManagerGenerator is quite a mouthful. Its a python script for xcode to generate a StoryboardManager class, it parses all storyboard files in a given directory and makes the UIStoryboard* easily accessible and create UIViewController from generated ID's. 

It script generates two sets of files:
  - _StoryBoardManager.h/.m - AutoGenerated BaseClass with all ID's and basic functionality
  - StoryBoardManager.h/.m - Customizable class that is only generated the first time script runs. 


StoryBoardManager.h
---------------------

```ObjectiveC
@interface _StoryBoardManager : NSObject

// Generated for each storyboard file found
+ (UIStoryboard*)main_iphoneStoryBoard;

+ (UIViewController*)viewController:(NSString*)viewControlelrID inStoryBoard:(NSString*)storyboardID;

@end 

// StoryBoardIDs

static NSString* StoryBoardID_Main= @"Main";

// Controller ID's 
static NSString* SBMainscreen_Main_tabbar = @"main_tabbar";

```

Naming Convention
----------

These naming conventions are just temporary, open to suggestions if there is anything people prefer or implementing various styles. 

StoryBoardID's are just StoryBoardID_{CapitalizedFirstLetter of storyboard filename}

```example
main_iPhone.storyboard = StoryBoardID_Main_iPhone
```

ControllerID's are the same SB_{CapitalizedFirstLetter storyboardFilename}_{storyboardIdentifier}

```example
main_iPhone.storyboard with controllers storyboardIdentifier "testVC"
ControllerID = SB_Main_iPhone_TestVC
```

Options
--------------
  

  
--root or -r is path to recursively search for .storyboard files default is project root

--dest or -d is path to output StoryBoardManager.h/.m and _StoryBoardManager.h/.m default is script directory


Installation
--------------

In your App Target add a new runscript

{ Python Directory } { path to generartor script } { options }

Example
```sh
/usr/bin/python scripts/StoryboardDefGenerator.py -d "Source"
```
  
Alternatively you can add a new build aggregator target and add put in a runscript in that. This allows you to generate the files whenever you want, i.e. after you edit a storyboard. 


More Info   
---------------
Welcome to suggestions, I plan on adding functionality as I need them. 
I'd like to create a cocoapod to automatically add this functionality to a project but havent gotten around to trying it.
